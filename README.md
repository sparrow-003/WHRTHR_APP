# 🌿 GaiaWeather: Nature-Synced Forecasts

GaiaWeather is a high-fidelity atmospheric experience designed to reconnect humans with the rhythm of the Earth. Instead of just numbers and icons, GaiaWeather uses real-time meteorological data to drive a living, breathing 3D environment and provides AI-powered nature insights.

## ✨ Core Features

- **Living Atmosphere**: A custom Three.js engine that renders rain, snow, clouds, and lighting based on real-time weather codes.
- **Nature Insights**: Powered by **Google Gemini 3 Flash**, the app analyzes current conditions to offer poetic descriptions and tips on how to synchronize your day with nature.
- **Scroll Parallax**: Subtle movement of the camera, landscape, and sky as you explore the UI, creating a sense of physical depth.
